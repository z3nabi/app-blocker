"""Outlook calendar integration — replaces the static schedule.

Public API:
    current_deep_work_event(now) -> dict | None
    last_sync_status() -> dict
    force_refresh() -> None
    start_background_sync(interval_seconds=60) -> None

Reads today's calendar events tagged with the configured category
("Deep Work" by default) from a running Outlook instance via COM,
caches them in-memory and to disk, and exposes a single function the
blocker tick loop calls to decide block/unblock.

Never launches Outlook (uses GetActiveObject, not EnsureDispatch /
Dispatch) — Outlook itself is a blocked app and self-launching it
would create a kill/relaunch loop.
